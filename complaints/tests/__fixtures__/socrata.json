More recently, they said they had tried to called me repeatedly but they never left a voicemail even though, once after they called and left a message with father-in-law, I did call them back, gave them my proper number, and gave them permission to leave messages, and also made sure they have my current address. \n\nI had to ask 3 times ( twice on the phone and once in writing ) that they stop contacting my in-laws. My mother in-law also spoke to them at least twice and told them I didnt live there. Y father-in-law spoke to them too. When Zwicker decided to sue me, they tried to deliver the court summons to my in-laws instead of me. When Zwickers representative later came to my house with it, he just threw it at the end of the driveway where I didnt even see it when I got home. Instead, my husband found it we had no idea how long it had been there. \n\nOver the phone, I agreed to pay {$250.00} a month and they started taking monthly payments out of the account. Said they would take two to begin with and then more after I returned the court paperwork. I returned the court paperwork on time and then they stopped taking the payments wed agreed upon. There was no information in the agreement saying what constituted default or that the balance being due immediately meant that they would try to take it from my checking account. To my knowledge, the did not try to contact me before filing paperwork to levy my bank account. \n\nThe money in my checking account was from a federal student loan and so is not eligible for garnishment. I called them to discuss the issue and was then told that I the money had been taken because I hadnt paid since XXXX, which I had not been aware of. I thought payments were being taken as agreed since I hadnt heard anything from them. The lawyer kept telling me to hang up and call the collections department and the collections department kept telling me to hang up and call the lawyer and I got nowhere with them. Eventually, even though they had just frozen {$2000.00} of my checking account money, I was told I still needed to give them a payment ASAP. When I asked if they were going to continue to take money out of my account on a daily basis if I didnt give them a payment, they couldnt say. When I asked how the {$2000.00} didnt count as a payment, they said, Because we had to take it. You didnt give it to us willingly. I told them not to contact me again until after XX/XX/XXXX since I had no idea where I was going to find money for them. They started calling me again less than a week later on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nOver the next week, I had to borrow money from my mother to cover my mortgage. I also borrowed money from sister to pay them {$250.00} for XXXX. After my husband and I got paid again, I sent them {$500.00} to make up for the missed months of XXXX and XXXX. As mentioned above, they called me again on XX/XX/XXXX. They didnt leave a message. They called again on XX/XX/XXXX. I answered and they asked me to pay the balance in full. I told the woman that I had a court judgement and that Id already sent them {$750.00} and that the {$2000.00} was still being held and that I had no more money for them. She said she had no record of any of that. I had to explain the entire court settlement/bank levy situation to her and then she had to go look for the checks I had sent. Thankfully she did eventually find them. She asked me if I was willing to set up a new payment plan. I told her I wanted to stick to the court judgement. She confirmed that my account is now up to date in accordance to that agreement, and that as long as I continued to pay on time, no more action would be taken. She also said that if I missed a payment by more than 30 days, it would be considered in default again. I asked her to confirm this 30-day policy and she twice confirmed that they dont take action until an account is 30 days past due. Of important note here, when Zwicker and Associates filed the paperwork to levy my bank account, it was only 28 days passed the payment due date.","non_null":350651,"null":"949391","top":[{"item":"There are many mistakes appear in my report without my understanding.","count":"1035"},{"item":"I have been a victim of identity theft.","count":"133"},{"item":"Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk.

A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block.\n\n( c ) Authority to decline or rescind.\n\n( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.\n\n( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title.\n\n( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.\n\n( d ) Exception for resellers.\n\n( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.\n\n( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.\n\n( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.\n\n( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.\n\n( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.","count":"82"},{"item":"Creditor is reporting accounts that are invalid and unverified.
